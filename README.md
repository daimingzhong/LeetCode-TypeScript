# LeetCode in Typescript

## Problem list
Most of the problems are from leetcode. Parts of them are from geeksforgeeks, lintcode, etc.

## Run and debug typescript with webstorm
* Run javascript under dist/

* Run typescript under src/
under Run/Debug Configuration (cmd + ;)
```
Node interpreter: node
Node parameters: --nolazy -r ts-node/register
Working directory: {your project dir}
JavaScript file: {your js file}
```
This method, inspired by how VSCode debugs typescript, uses node as an interpreter instead of ts-node.
